### Stack

- **Python:** Prefer Python 3.14. pathlib, inline comments, and docstrings. Modern typing: PEP585, PEP604, PEP649.
- **Tests:** pytest, factory-boy, pytest-mock. `make test` to run tests. or `uv run pytest`
- **Productivity:** Dependencies managed with `uv` via `pyproject.toml`; automation via `Makefile`; lint/format with Ruff.
- **Git:**  Include yourself in the commits as coauthor if helped enough. Use `gh cli` to open PRs / manage issues. Start a new branch for each feature or bugfix.
- **Github:** Prefer gh CLI for all interactions with Github if possible.

## Development environment

We use uv for development environment setup and management.
Check `make help` for some useful shortcuts.

## Lang preferences

- All text in the code in simple English (comments, docstrings, commit messages, PR descriptions). But respect the language I use for chatting.
- Please avoid any sexist language. Specially in languages like Spanish, where the gender of nouns is important. Use gender-neutral terms when possible.

## QA & Docs

- Docs sources in `docs/` using Markdown with Sphinx + myst-parser. `make docs` to build it.
- **Lint/format:** `make format` (Ruff configured in `pyproject.toml`).
